👋 ***Welcome!*** I am an ***Assistant Professor (tenure-track)*** at the Department of Computer Science, University of Bari Aldo Moro, where I specialize in ***machine learning***, ***deep learning***, and ***computer vision***, with applications in fields like ***e-health***, ***drone vision***, and ***digital humanities***. During the workday, if you don't spot me with my legs stretched out in my office on the sixth floor, I'm probably down in the [CILAB lab](https://sites.google.com/site/cilabuniba/home) on the fourth floor, where the real magic happens—or possibly in Professor [Giovanna Castellano](https://sites.google.com/site/cilabuniba/people/giovanna-castellano)'s office, stealing her *taralli* (a classic Italian snack 🥨) and handing them out to anyone who crosses my path!

With a *Ph.D. in Computer Science and Mathematics*, I'm deeply involved in advancing research, leading and contributing to diverse projects, including a recently concluded European initiative focused on computational methods for cultural heritage. I'm an Editorial Board member of the *International Journal of Intelligent Systems* and regularly organize scientific events. My role also involves mentoring Ph.D. students, reviewing for top-tier venues, and serving on program committees for several conferences. I'm also a member of *IEEE* and other scientific communities.

## 🚀 Current Research Projects

> ***🔔 Exciting News!***  
> A new collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Transport is about to take flight! I'll be leading a project focused on using drones to enhance roadside assistance, aiming to revolutionize emergency response on the road. Stay tuned for updates!

## 📚 Current Teaching
Teaching is a big part of what I do! Here are my current courses:
* 🧠 ***Deep Learning***, M.Sc. in Data Science
  
  Deep learning is still more like alchemy than chemistry—a blend of intuition, experimentation, and a bit of magic—but it's precisely this "alchemy" that powers AI as the transformative technology it is today. In this course, students dive into both the theoretical foundations and the hands-on applications of deep learning, exploring how neural networks and advanced architectures drive innovation across fields. 

* 🤖 ***Computational Intelligence***, B.Sc. in Computer Science

  This course explores the development of intelligent systems capable of adapting, learning from experience, and solving complex problems—essentially, systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Co-taught with Professor Corrado Mencar, my focus is on foundational neural networks, providing students with the basics of machine learning and its applications.

* 💻 ***Computer Science Laboratory***, B.Sc. Programs in Computer Science (Bari and Taranto)

  The course bridges the gap between programming theory and practical software engineering skills. It emphasizes coding fundamentals, allowing students to move from theory into practical application, building a foundation essential for advanced studies and industry practice.
